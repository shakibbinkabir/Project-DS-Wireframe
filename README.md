# Project DS - Wireframing

Welcome to wireframing of **Project DS**, a comprehensive solution for CoWorking Space company. This repository contains the wireframe designs developed using **draw.io**. The wireframes aim to outline the structure and flow of the project, including both the frontend and backend aspects, as well as data linking, API, and algorithms.

---

## 📂 Overview

**Project DS** is in its early stages, with the wireframing progress currently at **10%**. We are currently focused on designing the **frontend structure** of **CoDesk**, laying out the user interface and interaction flow for the platform. The wireframe will serve as a blueprint for the final implementation, ensuring a smooth transition between design and development.

### 🏗️ Wireframe Contents

- **Frontend Data Structure**: Outlining the UI/UX flow and user interaction points (currently under development).
- **Backend Data Structure**: Detailing database schemas, models, and relations (upcoming).
- **Data Linking Structure**: Mapping the flow of data between frontend and backend components (upcoming).
- **API & Data Server Structure**: Defining the endpoints and server interactions (upcoming).
- **Algorithms**: Preliminary outline of the core algorithms to be implemented (upcoming).
